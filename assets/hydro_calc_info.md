The calculation is based on the following fictitious **water wheel**:

* Location in the Aare in Bern
* Net head: 1 meter
* Width of the water wheel: 1 meter
* Performance Ratio: 0.21 (same as solar panel as information is hard to estimate for fictious water wheel)

### ðŸ§®  **Calculation info:**

**Water wheel energy production:**

* Power (watts) = Net head x effective flow rate x water acceleration
* Water acceleration: 9.81

**Aare width:**

* 40 meter

**COâ‚‚ Emission of Swiss Energy Mix:**

* 2021:  33.4 million tones of carbon dioxide

**Swiss Primary Energy Consumption:**

* 2021: 1.07 Exajoules = ~297'222'222'222 kWh

**Swiss COâ‚‚ emission per kWh 2021:**

* 33'400'000'000 / 297'222'222'222 = 0.11237 Kg/COâ‚‚ per kWh

**Offset calculation:**

* Hydro power (kWh) = (Net head x effective flow rate x water acceleration) x 24 / 1'000
* Daily offset hydro power = Hydro Power x Swiss COâ‚‚ emission per kWh
