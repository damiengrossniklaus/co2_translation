The calculation is based on the following **Solar Panel**:

* Solar panel size (mm): 1.767 x 1.041 x 35
* Power: 385 Wp
* Performance Ratio: 21 %

### ðŸ§®  **Calculation info:**

**Solar power energy production:**

* Daily watt-hours = average hours of sunlight x solar panel watts x performance ratio

**COâ‚‚ Emission of Swiss Energy Mix:**

* 2021:  33.4 million tones of carbon dioxide

**Swiss Primary Energy Consumption:**

* 2021: 1.07 Exajoules = ~297'222'222'222 kWh

**Swiss COâ‚‚ emission per kWh 2021:**

* 33'400'000'000 / 297'222'222'222 = 0.11237 Kg/COâ‚‚ per kWh

**Offset calculation:**

* Solar power (kWh) = average hours of sunlight x solar panel watts x performance ratio / 1'000
* Daily offset solar power = Solar Power x Swiss COâ‚‚ emission per kWh
